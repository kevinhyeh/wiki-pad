My story began when I was a photo retoucher <career /> years ago and impulsively took a UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. Since then, I utilize the best of both halves of my brain, bringing logic and creativity into my projects. From the small details to the large pictures, I make sure all aspects are thought of. My hope is to further that skill set and learn from as many people as I can. In this portfolio, I demonstrate the basic fundamentals of my current skill set.<b />Thank you for your time.",
